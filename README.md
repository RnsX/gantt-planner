# Introduction

## My Gantt Planner

My Gantt Planner project was intended for practicing *speed coding - design and delivery of concept in as short time as possible*. Such project format was chosen because there isn't enough time in the world for *outside of work* practice projects. 

The aim for the project was to cover basic things such as router-dom and state management (redux, useState hook) as well as some more interesting UI/UX elements such as movable sliders.

## Development length

Total development time for this project (from pencil draft concept idea to final build) was 16 hours

## Software stack

Web application was made using Typescript, ReactJS and Bootstrap
